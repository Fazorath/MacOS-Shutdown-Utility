A tiny utility to schedule an exact-time **shutdown** on macOS using either the **Shortcuts app** or the **command line**.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Accepts both **12-hour** (`11:25 PM`, `7pm`) and **24-hour** (`23:25`, `7:05`) input.  
- Auto-rollover to **tomorrow** if the time already passed today.  
- Compensates for macOS‚Äôs **10-minute shutdown grace** so the machine powers off at the exact time you typed.  
- Includes a one-click **Cancel** shortcut to clear scheduled shutdowns.  
- Works silently (no password prompts) with a minimal `sudoers` entry.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/macos-shutdown-shortcut.git
   cd macos-shutdown-shortcut
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh

2. **Allow passwordless pmset**
Open visudo:
sudo visudo
Add one of the following (replace yourusername):

# General (simplest)
yourusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pmset

# Or narrower (still works for this repo):
yourusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pmset schedule shutdown *, /usr/bin/pmset schedule cancelall
Test:
sudo -n /usr/bin/pmset -g sched
‚Üí Should not prompt for a password.

3. **üöÄ Usage**
Command line
# Schedule shutdown (auto-compensates 10 minutes early)
scripts/schedule-shutdown.sh "11:25 PM"

# Exact shutdown (no compensation)
scripts/schedule-shutdown.sh "23:10" --exact

# Cancel all scheduled events
scripts/cancel-shutdown.sh

# View current schedules
pmset -g sched

4. **Shortcuts app**
You can also use this inside the macOS Shortcuts app for a friendly UI.

# Schedule Shutdown Shortcut
Ask for Text ‚Üí Prompt: Shutdown time (e.g., 11:25 PM or 23:25)
Allow Multiple Lines: Off
Run Shell Script
Shell: bash
Script: /absolute/path/to/repo/scripts/schedule-shutdown.sh
Input: Ask for Text (the blue token)
Pass Input: as arguments
Show Notification
Title: Schedule Shutdown (optional)
Text: Shell Script Result (the blue token)
Attachment: (empty)

# Cancel Shutdown Shortcut
Run Shell Script
Script: /absolute/path/to/repo/scripts/cancel-shutdown.sh
Show Notification
Text: Shell Script Result
Export them as .shortcut files if you want to share.
**üìù Why compensation?**
On macOS, pmset schedule shutdown "<datetime>" starts a 10-minute countdown at that time.
This utility subtracts 10 minutes by default, so the machine powers off at the exact time you enter.
Pass --exact if you want no compensation.
**üîí Safety**
This utility only uses /usr/bin/pmset.
The sudoers entry is minimal and cannot be abused to run other commands.
You can remove the entry anytime via sudo visudo.
Always test with:
scripts/cancel-shutdown.sh
**‚úÖ Requirements**
macOS (with /usr/bin/pmset)
Admin user account (to edit sudoers)
Bash (macOS default is fine)
